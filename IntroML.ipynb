    "This notebook is written to help beginners and intermediate programmers get aquainted with Machine learning. This notebook will be split into three broad sections:\n",
    "####    - What is machine learning\n",
    "####    - Types of machine learning\n",
    "####    - Further steps/readings\n",

    "# What is machine learning?\n",
    "Machine learning is a useful tool that can help us identify trends or patterns in data that is not easily visible to us. At its core, machine learning is a set of mathematical models that we use to classify data, and then use those models to predict the behavior of any future/new data. \n",
    "### The important takeaway is that machine learning is nothing but the **application of math**, and **using the computer as a tool to do more than we could manually. "
